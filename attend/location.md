## Airports

Attendees are encouraged to fly directly into the Champaign airport 
(CMI). The airport is a short (15 minute) drive from the workshop location. 
Taxis and rideshare services (such as [Uber](https://uber.com) and 
[Lyft](https://lyft.com)) are available at the CMI airport.

Other nearby airports include Chicago (ORD and MDW), Indianapolis (IND), and 
Bloomington (BMI). If attendees fly into these airports, ground transportation 
to the Champaign area will be required. 

## Ground Transportation

**Ridesharing services** such as [Uber](https://www.uber.com/) and 
[Lyft](https://www.lyft.com/) are widely available in the area.

**Chicago is approximately 150 miles from Urbana-Champaign**, so if flying into 
Chicago (ORD or MDW), attendees may choose to rent a car or take a bus to 
Champaign.  The organizers recommend Peoria Charter in this case.  [Peoria 
Charter](https://peoriacharter.com/schedule.php?tt=OW) is a reliable bus 
company that offers several shuttles throughout the day from Chicago to the 
university. *The Altgeld Hall bus stop is less than one block from the Illini 
Union and the TownePlace Suites.* 

**Other regional airports,** such as BMI and IND also serve the Champaign area 
but will require renting a car. 


## Driving
By virtue of being in the central United States, Urbana-Champaign is within 
driving distance of many universities and national laboratories. In particular, 
U. Wisconsin, Purdue, Missouri S&T, Ohio State, and ANL are all within a 5-hour 
driving radius of Urbana, IL.


## Lodging

Please see this website's section on [lodging](./attend/lodging) for more 
information. Many hotels are available in the Urbana-Champaign area. However, 
the organizers recommend the Illini Union Hotel or Marriott TownePlace and 
Suites. Each are a short walk from any campus destination.
