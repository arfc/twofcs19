From Wednesday **June 26th, 2019 though Friday June 28th, 2019,** the fourth annual 
Technical Workshop on Fuel Cycle Simulation will be held at the [University of 
Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu), hosted by the Advanced Reactors and Fuel Cycles 
group. This workshop will broadly cover nuclear fuel cycle simulators, with 
tracks to be announced soon. There is no registration fee for TWoFCS. All are 
welcome to attend.


## Format
TWoFCS will be a truly technical workshop. Unlike a traditional meeting,
- Talks will be 10 minutes with 5 minutes for talk specific questions.
- Following talks, a session chair will lead 30-45 minutes of discussion on the topic.
- Dedicated note takers will capture the meeting minutes.

The purpose of the submitted abstracts should be to spark a discussion on a 
particular topic, answer questions from the attendees on the speaker's topic, 
and enable communal decision making on what areas of research are challenging 
or interesting.

**Please adjust your talk format to meet the goals of a discussion-oriented workshop.**

The outcome of this workshop will a compiled document of the presentations and 
associated discussions. Attendees will be invited to participate in a 
publication of a high-level summary paper following the workshop.
