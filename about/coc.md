All workshop attendees are required to agree with the following code of
conduct. Additionally, organizers will enforce this code throughout the event.
We expect cooperation from all attendees to help ensuring a safe environment for
everyone.

## The Quick Version

The meeting organizers are dedicated to providing a harassment-free 
experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, 
age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, 
ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. We do not 
tolerate harassment of group members or other colleagues in any form. Sexual 
language and imagery is not appropriate for any professional setting, including 
talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media. Research group 
members violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the group at 
the discretion of the organizers.

## The Less Quick Version

We are committed to providing an environment that promotes inclusiveness, open 
and honest dialog, friendly interactions, and active listening. We want all 
participants to feel welcomed, heard, and supported. To that end, we will not 
tolerate any harassment in any form at our workshop.

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender 
identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical 
appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual 
images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, 
harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of the research 
environment, talks, or other events, inappropriate physical contact, unwelcome 
sexual attention, or creation of an otherwise sexualized environment.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply 
immediately. If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the organizers may 
take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or 
expulsion from the meeting.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have 
any other concerns, please contact a workshop organizer immediately. You can also 
make a report in the following ways:

- Email: kdhuff@illinois.edu
- Phone: 281-734-1342
- Anonymously via [this reporting form](https://goo.gl/forms/rDGbLQpKLmF2jUAI2)

Workshop organizers will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue 
security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those 
experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the symposium. We 
value your attendance.

If the organizers are the cause of the concern or you would prefer they not be involved, 
official concerns can be addressed by contacting the 
[UIUC WeCare office](http://wecare.illinois.edu/), or the 
[Campus Office of Diversity, Equity and Access](http://www.diversity.illinois.edu/).

We expect participants to follow these rules at all meeting venues and 
meeting-related social events.
