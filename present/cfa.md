## Workshop Description

This workshop seeks to bring together the community of nuclear fuel cycle 
experts, simulation analysts, simulator developers, and other stakeholders. 
Presentation, demonstration, and communication will focus on the technical 
concerns of nuclear fuel cycle simulation relevant in various nations and 
institutions involved in the field. Accordingly, this workshop contributes to 
building a community and potential collaborations around nuclear scenario 
topics, simulation design, and simulator tool strategies. 

## Organizers

TWOFCS19 organizers are listed on [this section of website](../../about/organizers).

## Location

The workshop will be in Urbana, IL at the University of Illinois at 
Urbana-Champaign. More details about the venue can be found on [this section of 
the website](../../attend/location).

## Deadlines

- **Abstract Deadline:** March 1, 2019
- **Optional Full Paper Deadline:** June 1, 2019
- **Registration Deadline:** June 1, 2019
- **Workshop:** June 26-28, 2019

## Registration

Registration for this workshop has no fee. Please register so that the 
organizers may obtain a headcount, print badges, and keep you up to date. 
Registration may be submitted [here](../../attend/register). 

## Abstract Format

Please submit a plain text abstract of approximately 400 words (or 3000 
characters) to the [abstract submission form](../abstract).


The purpose of the submitted abstracts should be to spark a discussion on a 
particular topic, answer questions from the attendees on the speaker's topic, 
and enable communal decision making on what areas of research are challenging 
or interesting. 

Authors of accepted abstracts will be invited to *optionally* submit a full 
length paper which may be considered for a special issue in Nuclear Technology.


## Topics of Interest

Talks on the following topics are encouraged. 

### Benchmarking Efforts
Describe code-to-code benchmarking efforts, propose challenge problems, identify lessons learned in benchmarking efforts, or identify benchmarking needs
### Incorporation of Machine Learning and Optimization
Introduce ways in which machine learning algorithms, optimization methods, and other data science approaches have been or could be used to improve simulator behavior, results, predictive analysis, and optimization.
### Transition scenario studies
Reveal scenario descriptions and simulation results in the category of long-term technology transition, discuss modeling challenges for simulations of this kind, etc.
### Nonproliferation Applications and Modeling Approaches
Discuss approaches to modeling shadow fuel cycles, simulating diversion detection scenarios, calculating nonproliferation metrics, and other fuel cycle simulator contributions to nonproliferation applications.
### Uncertainty & Sensitivity analysis
Discuss and demonstrate new approaches to and implementations of uncertainty and sensitivity analysis in fuel cyle simulation.
### Economics and Policy Modeling
Share strategies and implementations for modeling economics, policy, and other interdisciplinary approaches relevant to nuclear fuel cycle simulation.
### Simulation results visualization
Share visualization tools, user interface design, GUI development, human computer interaction insights, and approaches for communicating simulation results.
### User experience and community management
Discuss the user experience, including new user obstacles, community development, etc.
### Fuel Cycle Code Development and Capabilities
Share fuel cycle modeling capabilities of various codes
### Advanced technology modeling approaches
Sharing advanced modeling capabilities and approaches for representing new technologies (e.g. reactor types) and fuel cycles (e.g. reprocessing, waste management).

## Full Papers

Upon abstract acceptance, presenters will be invited to submit an optional full paper.
These can be submitted as pdfs in any format. Maximum length: 10 pages. 
Deadline for full paper submission: **June 1, 2019.**

## Workshop Format

TWOFCS will be a truly technical workshop. Unlike a traditional meeting,

- Talks will be 10 minutes long.
- Following a series of related talks, there will be 15 - 20 minutes of speaker-led discussion on the topic.
- Dedicated note takers will be available for the meeting minutes.
- The workshop will have all-hands discussions and topic-specific parallel tracks.

Please adjust your talk format to meet the goals of a discussion-oriented workshop. 


The outcome of this workshop will a compiled document of the presentations, 
abstracts, and full papers. Attendees will be invited to participate in a 
publication of a high-level summary paper following the workshop.
